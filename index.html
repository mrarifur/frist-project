                    <p> While the Dragon Ball Super manga continued to release new chapters month after month after the anime's 131-episode run, fans are wondering when Toei Animation will produce new episodes for the popular anime series. So far, Toei hasn't announced the return of Dragon Ball Super anime, but many have speculated that it will return by 2022, three years after Dragon Ball Super: Broly premiered in Japan. Hopefully, the studio will make an official announcement by mid of 2021.
