So far, Toei hasn't announced the return of Dragon Ball Super anime, but many have speculated that it will return by 2022, three years after Dragon Ball Super: Broly premiered in Japan. Hopefully, the studio will make an official announcement by mid of 2021.

In the art, the auras are surrounded by a halo of energy.</p>
